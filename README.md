# Poster and Bytes of Unity Project

## Overview
This project brings together two unique Python-based initiatives:
1. **Poster Code**: A project focused on advanced image processing, enabling creative transformations and enhancements of digital posters.
2. **Bytes of Unity**: A Python-driven storytelling project where we use programming to create elements of a movie, combining data, visuals, and narrative into an engaging cinematic experience.

These projects demonstrate the versatility of Python in blending technical and creative domains, showcasing the power of programming to manipulate visuals and craft engaging stories.

## Features
### Poster Code
- **Image Processing**: Advanced transformations and enhancements using libraries like OpenCV and Pillow.
- **Custom Effects**: Application of filters, overlays, and other artistic techniques to create visually striking posters.
- **Automated Workflows**: Streamlined processes for importing, processing, and exporting images.

### Bytes of Unity
- **Narrative Creation**: Scripting a storyline with Python, integrating visuals, text, and animations.
- **Dynamic Visuals**: Creating scenes and visual effects to bring the movie to life.
- **Data-Driven Cinematics**: Leveraging data to guide visual elements and enhance storytelling.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenCV
- Pillow
- Pandas
- NumPy
